 pwns the silsvc and sbcore services


This basically helps you pwn the licensing services on a Windows SBS server. There are many totally legit reasons you may need to do this:
* P2V an old server for a legacy LOB application, no longer requiring it to be a DC.
* Running the SBS in VM on the host, the host needs the service disabled to prevent it from rebooting and taking the VM with it.
